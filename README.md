# fivecents-microservices-demo
This repository contains the sources of a fictive five-cents company information system, used to make some demo about  microservices (Thorntail, Springboot...), REST, and EIP (Camel).
We are also making the exercise of mouting all those systems on container (Docker, Kubernets, OpenShift) to understand the concepts and interests.

All these sources are detailed on https://cailleteau.org/2018/09/12/five-cents-demo/
